This code contains 3 video games in which you can get a score by piloting a helicopter. Moreover, using the concept of Genetic Algorithms, the AI for this game was created so that if you play the game in AI mode, the game learns to get better scores as it keeps playing.

Here is a picture of the result that was achieved after training the agent for n epochs. The plot shows the most number of steps the agent takes before being eliminated. The x-axis is the number of epochs for training and the y-axis is the number of steps the agent takes before being eliminated.
